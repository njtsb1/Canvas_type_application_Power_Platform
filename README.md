The challenge of this project is to create a Canvas (Screen) application.
This application must be made available in MS Dynamics 365 CE, accessible in the "Course Management" app from an existing form on the Courses entity.

**The project will have four stages, and you must follow them as described below:**

1. The application must be created using the model-driven concept, using the data source of the currently running form context as shown in the lessons.
Requirements for this first stage:

- Header must be included.
- A text input field of the combo box type (ComboBox) allowing selection of the course.
- Detail (Gallery-type component) must be included.
- The text input field must be a combo box (ComboBox) allowing selection of the instructor.

2. Create a Power Automate flow.

3. Create a flow so that when a new instructor record is created, an email is sent (the email address will be the one provided in the instructor’s registration).

4. Export the application and post it on the classroom portal, together with the spreadsheet used to load the state data.
